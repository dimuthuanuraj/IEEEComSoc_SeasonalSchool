            <p>
                Mr. Somaskandan Suthakar is a senior lecturer in Computer Science at the Faculty of Science,
                University of Jaffna. With a career spanning over two decades, he has been lecturing at the
                Department of Computer Science since 2001. He has completed postgraduate certificate courses
                at Uppsala University, Sweden, specialising in Image Analysis and Medical Visualization, and
                obtained his M.Phil in Computer Science from the University of Jaffna, Sri Lanka in 2014. His
                research interests primarily lie in algorithmic approaches in Medical Image Analysis, where he has
                made significant contributions.
                Additionally, throughout his career, Mr. Suthakar has demonstrated a deep passion for Robotics
                and Electronics, which has been a driving force since his childhood. He showcased his innovative
                ideas by winning numerous electronics and new invention competitions during his school days.
                Since then, he has been actively involved in mentoring students and assisting them in the
                development of IoT and robotics devices. He has also served as a resource person in several
                workshops, both within and outside the university, and is actively engaged in ongoing research
                related to Automated Vehicles and IoT, further expanding his expertise and knowledge in these
                areas.
